<h1 id="the-dadc-shared-task">The DADC Shared Task</h1>
<p>The DADC Shared Task this year will focus on the Extractive Question Answering (QA) task. We hope to expand to other NLP-related tasks in future iterations of the competition.</p>
<p>Register your team's interest in participating <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfKXEFdkgkvxzZfvtT7EXhmzHjpzTYldca76Fd4P8APfvyGBA/viewform">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-participate">How to Participate</h2>
<h3 id="track-1-better-annotators">Track 1: Better Annotators</h3>
<p>Participants will submit 100 &quot;official&quot; question answering (QA) examples through the <a href="https://dynabench.org/tasks/qa">Dynabench</a> platform. The collected dataset will form parts of the evaluation set for Tracks 2 and 3. The objective is to find as many model-fooling examples as possible -- the winning team will be the one with the highest validated model error rate (vMER).</p>
<h4 id="participation-instructions">Participation Instructions</h4>
<ol>
<li>Create an &quot;official&quot; Dynabench account for your team (and share your account username with us when filling out the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfKXEFdkgkvxzZfvtT7EXhmzHjpzTYldca76Fd4P8APfvyGBA/viewform">Team Registration Form</a>).</li>
<li>Test out <a href="https://dynabench.org/tasks/qa/create">Dynabench QA Interface</a>. <strong>Important: DO NOT use your &quot;official&quot; shared task account for this. We recommend that you either create personal test accounts or switch to Sandbox mode in the interface.</strong>. You are free to interact with the model as often as you like from your <em>test</em> accounts to try to identify model failure patterns.</li>
<li>The actual submission will occur over a 2-week <em>Track 1 Example Creation</em> window. The organisers will provide a new set of annotation passages, but you will be competing against the <a href="https://dynabench.org/models/109">current best QA model</a> which will remain the same as during the previous testing phase. Some rules regarding the official submission phase:
<ul>
<li>You should only submit <strong>100</strong> examples from your <em>official</em> participation account. If you submit more than 100, only the first 100 will be taken into consideration.</li>
<li>You will <strong>NOT</strong> be allowed to retract examples.</li>
<li>You <strong>MUST provide explanations</strong> for all your <strong>model-fooling</strong> examples only.</li>
<li>You are <strong>NOT</strong> allowed to use sandbox mode on passages for which you will submit questions to the competition.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Once the <em>Track 1 Example Creation</em> window is over, your submitted examples will get validated by an <strong>expert validator</strong>. Please refer to the <a href="/shared-task/#validation-instructions">Validation Instructions</a> below for more information.</li>
<li>The winning team will be the one with the highest validated model error rate (vMER).</li>
<li>By participating, you agree to make any of the data you submit available for public release.</li>
</ol>
<p>After validation and cleaning, this dataset will form part of the validation and testing for the other competition tracks.</p>
<h4 id="validation-instructions">Validation Instructions</h4>
<ol>
<li>Questions must have only one valid answer in the passage.</li>
<li>The shortest span which correctly answers the question is selected.</li>
<li>Questions can be correctly answered from a span in the passage and DO NOT require a Yes or No answer.</li>
<li>Questions can be answered from the content of the passage and DO NOT rely on expert external knowledge but can rely on <em>commonsense</em> knowledge (e.g. knowing that the sky is blue).</li>
<li>DO NOT ask questions about the passage structure such as <em>&quot;What is the third word in the passage?&quot;</em>.</li>
<li>There should be NO duplicate (or very similar) model-fooling questions. To ensure this, we require that all your model-fooling example for the same passage have different answers.</li>
<li>You <em>MUST provide explanations</em> for all your <em>model-fooling examples only</em>.</li>
<li>If the interface suggests that you didn't fool the model, but you actually consider the model to be fooled, please prepend the text <strong>MODELFOOLED</strong> to your explanation and then provide the explanation for why the model is fooled as normal. </li>
</ol>
<p>Valid examples should be questions about the content of the passage (not its structure) that the model answers incorrectly and a sufficiently well-trained human answers correctly.</p>
<p>These instructions may be updated by the workshop organisers prior to the start of the <em>Track 1 Example Creation</em> window.</p>
<h3 id="track-2-better-training-data">Track 2: Better Training Data</h3>
<p>In this data-centric track, participants will submit 10,000 <strong>training</strong> examples (in SQuAD v1.1 JSON format, see <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/adversarial_qa#dataset-structure">https://huggingface.co/datasets/adversarial_qa#dataset-structure</a>). These examples can be selected from existing datasets, expert-annotated, crowdsourced, or synthetically-generated. The workshop organisers will then train ELECTRA-Large models and evaluate them on the data collected in Track 1. The team with the highest word-overlap F1 score on the test set will be considered the winner.</p>
<p>To facilitate participation in this task, <strong>we make a variety of resources available</strong> including datasets, question generator models, and general tools and utilities at <a href="https://github.com/dadcworkshop/shared-task-resources">https://github.com/dadcworkshop/shared-task-resources</a>.</p>
<h4 id="participation-instructions-1">Participation Instructions</h4>
<ol>
<li>Each team must submit 10,000 <strong>training</strong> examples (in SQuAD v1.1 JSON format, see <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/adversarial_qa#dataset-structure">https://huggingface.co/datasets/adversarial_qa#dataset-structure</a>). Submissions in the <strong>wrong format</strong> will be <strong>disqualified</strong>.</li>
<li>It is the team’s responsibility to ensure that all question IDs are unique.</li>
<li>Data can be self-annotated, selected from existing datasets, synthetically generated, crowdsourced, etc. Please also refer to the <a href="https://github.com/dadcworkshop/shared-task-resources">DADC Shared Task resources</a>.</li>
<li>The submitted data cannot include passages from the test set. These will be made available by the start of the <em>Track 1 Example Creation</em> window. Any examples for which we find significant overlap will be removed.</li>
<li>The <strong>workshop organisers</strong> will then train five (5) ELECTRA-Large models on your provided training dataset using the default 🤗 HuggingFace hyper-parameters and different random seeds (these will not be disclosed in advance).</li>
<li>We will create both a <em>validation</em> and <em>test</em> set from the <em>Track 1 Dataset</em> that will be used to determine which model checkpoint to use and evaluate these models.</li>
<li>We will evaluate word-overlap F1 score of each model on the <em>Track 1 Test Dataset</em>.</li>
<li>Your official result will be the median score of the <strong>best 3 performing models (of the 5 trained)</strong>.</li>
<li>The team with the highest word-overlap F1 score on the test set will be considered the winner.</li>
