# The First Workshop on Dynamic Adversarial Data Collection (DADC)

Website coming soon, please stay tuned!

This website is built using the Jekyll minimal theme: https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal

## Build instructions

1. Install docker and docker-compose
2. Run `docker-compose up`
3. Usually, Jekyll rebuilds on file changes, but for some reason using docker this doesn't happen. Therefore, you'll need to ctrl-c and rerun docker-compose for each change OR figure out why its not working as expected ;).
