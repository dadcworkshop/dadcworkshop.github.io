## The DADC Shared Task
The DADC Shared Task this year will focus on the Extractive Question Answering (QA) task. We have three (3) tracks focusing on better annotators, better training data and better models.

**Specific details and a call for participation can be found [here](/shared-task/). Here's a quick overview:** 

### Track 1: Better Annotators
Participants will submit 100 "official" question answering (QA) examples through the [Dynabench](https://dynabench.org/tasks/qa) platform. The collected dataset will form parts of the evaluation set for Tracks 2 and 3. The objective is to find as many model-fooling examples as possible -- the winning team will be the one with the highest validated model error rate (vMER).

If you think you have what it takes to fool our best AI model, [sign up](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfKXEFdkgkvxzZfvtT7EXhmzHjpzTYldca76Fd4P8APfvyGBA/viewform) today!

### Track 2: Better Training Data
In this data-centric track, participants will submit 10,000 **training** examples (in SQuAD v1.1 JSON format, see [https://huggingface.co/datasets/adversarial_qa#dataset-structure](https://huggingface.co/datasets/adversarial_qa#dataset-structure)). These examples can be selected from existing datasets, expert-annotated, crowdsourced, or synthetically-generated. The workshop organisers will then train ELECTRA-Large models and evaluate them on the data collected in Track 1. The team with the highest word-overlap F1 score on the test set will be considered the winner.    

### Track 3: Better Models
The workshop organisers have pre-specified a set of evaluation weights for the [Dynabench](https://dynabench.org/tasks/qa) QA leaderboard. Participants can train any models on any data and submit their models directly to [Dynabench](https://dynabench.org/tasks/qa). The team with the highest **dynascore** will be considered the winner.

### Overall
Teams can choose to participate on individual tracks only. To further encourage the formation of diverse teams working on a range of challenges, we will also have an overall DADC Shared Task Winning Team based on performance across all 3 tracks.
