<p>This talk provides an overview of the current landscape of resources for Question Answering and Reading comprehension, highlighting the current lacunae for future work. I will also present a new taxonomy of &quot;skills&quot; targeted by QA/RC datasets and discuss various ways in which questions may be unanswerable.</p>

<p>Dynamic and/or adversarial data collection can be quite useful as a way of collecting training data for machine-learning models, identifying the conditions under which these models fail, and conducting online head-to-head comparisons between models. However, it is essentially impossible to use these practices to build usable static benchmark datasets for use in evaluating or comparing future new models. I defend this point using a mix of conceptual and empirical points, focusing on the claims (i) that adversarial data collection can skew the distribution of phenomena such as to make it unrepresentative of the intended task, and (ii) that adversarial data collection can arbitrarily shift the rankings of models on its resulting test sets to disfavor systems that are qualitatively similar to the current state of the art.</p>

<p>I'll discuss two examples of our work putting experienced writers in
front of a retrieval-driven adversarial authoring system: question
writing and fact-checking.  For question answering, we develop a
retrieval-based adversarial authoring platform and create incentives
to get people to use our system in the first place, write
interesting questions humans can answer, and challenge a QA system.
While the best humans lose to computer QA systems on normal questions,
computers struggle to answer our adversarial questions.  We then turn
to fact checking, creating a new game (Fool Me Twice) to solicit
difficult-to-verify claims---that can be either true or false---and to
test how difficult the claims are both for humans and computers.  We
argue that the focus on retrieval is important for knowledge-based
adversarial examples because it highlights diverse information,
prevents frustration in authors, and takes advantage of users'
expertise.</p>

<h4 id="data-excellence-better-data-for-better-ai">Data Excellence: Better Data for Better AI</h4>

<img src="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dadcworkshop.github.io&#x2F;processed_images&#x2F;38ecd0935d512dd400.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 30px" />
<p>The efficacy of machine learning (ML) models depends on both algorithms and data. Training data defines what we want our models to learn, and testing data provides the means by which their empirical progress is measured. Benchmark datasets define the entire world within which models exist and operate, yet research continues to focus on critiquing and improving the algorithmic aspect of the models rather than critiquing and improving the data with which our models operate. If “data is the new oil,” we are still missing work on the refineries by which the data itself could be optimized for more effective use. In this talk, I will discuss data excellence and lessons learned from software engineering to achieve the scare and rigor in assessing data quality.</p>

<p>Assistive models have been shown useful for supporting humans in creating challenging datasets, but how exactly do they help? In this talk, I will discuss different roles of assistive models in counterfactual data collection (i.e., perturbing existing text inputs to gain insight into task model decision boundaries), and the characteristics associated with these roles. I will use three examples (CheckList, Polyjuice, Tailor) to demonstrate how our objectives shift when we perturb texts for evaluation, explanation, and improvement, and how that change the corresponding assistive models from enhancing human goals (requiring model controllability) to competing with human bias (requiring careful data reranking). I will conclude by exploring additional roles that these models can play to become more effective.</p>

<h2 id="the-dadc-shared-task">The DADC Shared Task</h2>
<p>The DADC Shared Task this year will focus on the Extractive Question Answering (QA) task. We have three (3) tracks focusing on better annotators, better training data and better models.</p>
<p><strong>Specific details and a call for participation can be found <a href="/shared-task/">here</a>. Here's a quick overview:</strong> </p>
<h3 id="track-1-better-annotators">Track 1: Better Annotators</h3>
<p>Participants will submit 100 &quot;official&quot; question answering (QA) examples through the <a href="https://dynabench.org/tasks/qa">Dynabench</a> platform. The collected dataset will form parts of the evaluation set for Tracks 2 and 3. The objective is to find as many model-fooling examples as possible -- the winning team will be the one with the highest validated model error rate (vMER).</p>
<p>If you think you have what it takes to fool our best AI model, <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfKXEFdkgkvxzZfvtT7EXhmzHjpzTYldca76Fd4P8APfvyGBA/viewform">sign up</a> today!</p>
<h3 id="track-2-better-training-data">Track 2: Better Training Data</h3>
<p>In this data-centric track, participants will submit 10,000 <strong>training</strong> examples (in SQuAD v1.1 JSON format, see <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/adversarial_qa#dataset-structure">https://huggingface.co/datasets/adversarial_qa#dataset-structure</a>). These examples can be selected from existing datasets, expert-annotated, crowdsourced, or synthetically-generated. The workshop organisers will then train ELECTRA-Large models and evaluate them on the data collected in Track 1. The team with the highest word-overlap F1 score on the test set will be considered the winner.</p>
<h3 id="track-3-better-models">Track 3: Better Models</h3>
<p>The workshop organisers have pre-specified a set of evaluation weights for the <a href="https://dynabench.org/tasks/qa">Dynabench</a> QA leaderboard. Participants can train any models on any data and submit their models directly to <a href="https://dynabench.org/tasks/qa">Dynabench</a>. The team with the highest <strong>dynascore</strong> will be considered the winner.</p>
<h3 id="overall">Overall</h3>
<p>Teams can choose to participate on individual tracks only. To further encourage the formation of diverse teams working on a range of challenges, we will also have an overall DADC Shared Task Winning Team based on performance across all 3 tracks.</p>
